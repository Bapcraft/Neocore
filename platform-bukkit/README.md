# Neocore-Bukkit

This is the Bukkit host plugin for Neocore.  In order to build this project,
you should check out the `neocore.d` project and follow the instructions
there.

Once you have a jar named something along the lines of
`neocore-bukkit-0.0.1-MC1.9.4-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the `target` folder, then you
can copy it into your server's `plugins` directory.

You should probably not be using this project as a direct dependency, instead
you should be using the Neocore API as a dependency.
